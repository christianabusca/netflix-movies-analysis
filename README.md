# 🎬 Investigating Netflix Movies

A data analysis project exploring Netflix movie trends, durations, and patterns using Python, pandas, and matplotlib.

## 📋 Project Overview

This project started as a guided DataCamp exercise and has been expanded to enhance my Python data analysis skills. The analysis focuses on understanding movie duration trends, genre distributions, and content patterns in the Netflix catalog.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze movie duration trends across different decades
- Explore genre distributions and patterns
- Investigate relationships between release years, countries, and movie characteristics
- Practice data manipulation, analysis, and visualization techniques

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **pandas** - Data manipulation and analysis
- **matplotlib** - Data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** / Python scripts

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset (`netflix_data.csv`) contains information about Netflix content including:
- Show ID and type (Movie/TV Show)
- Title and director
- Cast and country of origin
- Release year and date added to Netflix
- Duration and genre
- Description

**Source:** This dataset originates from a DataCamp project exercise.

## 🔍 Analysis Performed

### Phase 1: Initial Exploration
- Filtered movie data from the 1990s (1990-1999)
- Created histogram visualizing movie duration distribution
- Analyzed short Action movies (< 90 minutes)

### Phase 2: Extended Analysis
*This section will be updated as I continue expanding the project*

- [ ] Genre popularity trends
- [ ] Duration trends across decades
- [ ] Country-based content analysis
- [ ] TV Shows vs Movies comparison
- [ ] Comprehensive visualization dashboard
